# HartsSinusCalc

HartsSinusCalc is a web calculator that estimates the probability of acute bacterial sinusitis. The calculation follows the **EPOS 2012** (European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps) and **AAO-HNSF** (American Academy of Otolaryngology â€“ Head and Neck Surgery Foundation) guidelines.
Documentation is also available in [Portuguese](README.md).
